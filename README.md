  ## Description:
  Employee Directory application is a simple application that allows the user to view a random workplace employee directory. During this project, I was able to further my understanding of using Reactjs. This allowed an easy way to access an open API and format data in a readable format for the viewer. One main issue that I had to overcome was the connection of components. React allows the user to set up custom tags and give props to be passed down to children components.

  ## Installation:
  Once cloned down, start by initializing dependencies through npm i. To run the server with React, run npm start within terminal. The browser will load to localhost and a table of randomly generated employees will be displayed. The user can sort employees by first or last name through the on click features in the heading.
